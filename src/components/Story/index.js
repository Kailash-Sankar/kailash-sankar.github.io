      <div>
        <span>More</span>I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. After
        graduation, I started as a backend developer on Perl (CGI and Catalyst)
        framework. Then I picked the vanilla flavors of frontend - HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. After two years in Perl I realized it&apos;s time to pick up
        another language, Python seemed like an obvious choice. I&apos;ve built
        apps in Django, MySQL along with Angular.js, Material design lite and
        Bootstrap.
      </div>

      <div>
        Next I switched my focus on to JavaScript. I wrote a few plugins in js
        and started working with Node. I worked closely with anlytics teams
        developing APIs which query big data sources like Elasticsearch and
        Cassandra directly.
      </div>

      <div>
        Now I&apos;m working on migrating a legacy Python/Django(v1) application
        on to a modern stack, React/Node(Koa).
